    "The `format_suggestions_and_rewrite_prompt` function constructs a prompt string that includes the grading feedback and the student's essay. This prompt is used to generate suggestions for improvement and to rewrite the essay using the suggested improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **grading_feedback** (`str`): The feedback received from grading the essay, which includes the criterion, score, and explanation.\n",
    "- **essay_text** (`str`): The text of the essay to be improved and rewritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "- **prompt** (`str`): A formatted string that includes the grading feedback and the student's essay, with specific instructions for generating suggestions and rewriting the essay.

    "### Description\n",
    "The `generate_suggestions_and_rewrite_essay` function takes grading feedback, an essay text, and a model to generate suggestions for improvement and rewrite the essay using those suggestions. The function constructs a prompt using the `format_suggestions_and_rewrite_prompt` function, which combines the grading feedback and essay text into a single prompt. It then uses the provided AI model to generate the suggestions and rewritten essay. If the API request fails due to resource exhaustion, the function retries the request up to a specified number of times, with exponential backoff between attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **model** (`GenerativeModel`): The AI model used to generate the content.\n",
    "- **grading_feedback** (`str`): The feedback received from grading the essay, which includes the criterion, score, and explanation.\n",
    "- **essay_text** (`str`): The text of the essay to be improved and rewritten.\n",
    "- **retries** (`int`, optional): The number of times to retry the API request in case of resource exhaustion. Default is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "- **response.text** (`str`): The suggestions and rewritten essay generated by the model. If the API request fails after the specified number of retries, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "1. **Construct Prompt**: The function calls the `format_suggestions_and_rewrite_prompt` function, passing in the grading feedback and essay text. This function returns a formatted prompt string.\n",
    "2. **Generate Content**: The function uses the AI model to generate content based on the constructed prompt. It attempts to call the model's `generate_content` method.\n",
    "3. **Retry Mechanism**: If the API request fails due to resource exhaustion, the function catches the `ResourceExhausted` exception and retries the request up to the specified number of times, with exponential backoff between attempts.\n",
    "4. **Return Response**: If the model successfully generates a response, the function returns the generated text. If the request fails after all retries, the function returns `None`.\n"

    "The American Revolution, which occurred from 1775 to 1783, was a pivotal event in history that not only led to the birth of a new nation but also had profound and lasting impacts on modern American society. This essay explores the significance of the American Revolution, examining its influence on contemporary political systems, social structures, and cultural values in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the American Revolution laid the foundation for the modern American political system. The revolutionaries' fight for independence was rooted in the desire for self-governance and the rejection of tyrannical rule. This struggle culminated in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which articulated the fundamental principles of liberty, equality, and democracy. These principles became the cornerstone of the United States Constitution, adopted in 1787, which established a federal republic with a system of checks and balances designed to prevent the concentration of power. Today, these democratic ideals continue to shape American politics, ensuring that power is derived from the consent of the governed and that individual rights are protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the American Revolution had a profound impact on the social fabric of the nation. The revolution challenged existing social hierarchies and promoted the idea of equality. While the promise of equality was not immediately realized for all groups, the rhetoric of the revolution inspired subsequent movements for social justice. The abolitionist movement, which sought to end slavery, drew upon the revolutionary principles of liberty and equality. Similarly, the women's suffrage movement, which fought for women's right to vote, was influenced by the revolution's emphasis on individual rights. These movements have played a crucial role in shaping a more inclusive and equitable society, reflecting the enduring legacy of the American Revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Culturally, the American Revolution fostered a sense of national identity and unity. The shared struggle for independence created a collective memory and a sense of common purpose among the American people. This sense of unity was further reinforced by the creation of national symbols, such as the flag and the national anthem, which continue to evoke patriotic sentiments. Additionally, the revolution gave rise to a distinct American culture that valued individualism, self-reliance, and innovation. These cultural values have profoundly influenced various aspects of American life, including the economy, education, and popular culture, contributing to the country's dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the American Revolution was a transformative event that has had a lasting impact on modern American society. It established the foundational principles of American democracy, inspired social movements for equality, and fostered a unique national identity and culture. The legacy of the American Revolution continues to resonate in contemporary America, shaping its political systems, social structures, and cultural values. As Americans reflect on their history, the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and democracy remain guiding principles for the nation's ongoing pursuit of a more just and equitable society.\n",

       "The American Revolution, which occurred from 1775 to 1783, was a pivotal event in history that not only led to the birth of a new nation but also had profound and lasting impacts on modern American society. This essay explores the significance of the American Revolution, examining its influence on contemporary political systems, social structures, and cultural values in the United States.\n",
       "\n",
       "Firstly, the American Revolution laid the foundation for the modern American political system. The revolutionaries' fight for independence was rooted in the desire for self-governance and the rejection of tyrannical rule. This struggle culminated in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which articulated the fundamental principles of liberty, equality, and democracy. These principles became the cornerstone of the United States Constitution, adopted in 1787, which established a federal republic with a system of checks and balances designed to prevent the concentration of power. Today, these democratic ideals continue to shape American politics, ensuring that power is derived from the consent of the governed and that individual rights are protected.\n",

The revolution undeniably challenged existing social hierarchies and promoted the idea of equality, as evidenced by... However, this promise of equality was not immediately realized for all groups.  The institution of slavery persisted, starkly contradicting the Revolution's rhetoric of liberty. Similarly, women remained largely excluded from the political sphere...\n",

The abolitionist movement, which sought to end slavery, drew upon the revolutionary principles of liberty and equality. Similarly, the women's suffrage movement, which fought for women's right to vote, was influenced by the revolution's emphasis on individual rights. \n",

For example, the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War marked a turning point in the fight for racial equality, directly stemming from the unresolved legacy of slavery after the Revolution. Similarly, the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, granting women the right to vote, demonstrated the evolving interpretation of the Revolution's ideals over time.\n",

This sense of unity was further reinforced by the creation of national symbols, such as the flag and the national anthem, which continue to evoke patriotic sentiments. Additionally, the revolution gave rise to a distinct American culture that valued individualism, self-reliance, and innovation.
