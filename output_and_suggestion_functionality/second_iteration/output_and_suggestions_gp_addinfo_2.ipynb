    "### Description\n",
    "The `format_suggestions_and_rewrite_prompt` function constructs a prompt string that includes the grading feedback and the student's essay. This prompt is used to generate suggestions for improvement and to rewrite the essay using the suggested improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **grading_feedback** (`str`): The feedback received from grading the essay, which includes the criterion, score, and explanation.\n",
    "- **essay_text** (`str`): The text of the essay to be improved and rewritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "- **prompt** (`str`): A formatted string that includes the grading feedback and the student's essay, with specific instructions for generating suggestions and rewriting the essay. The instructions ask for the smallest chunk of the original text where each improvement was applied, the criterion from the rubric, and the reason for the suggested improvement, all formatted in JSON.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "The `generate_suggestions_and_rewrite_essay` function takes grading feedback, an essay text, and a model to generate suggestions for improvement and rewrite the essay using those suggestions. The function constructs a prompt using the `format_suggestions_and_rewrite_prompt` function, which combines the grading feedback and essay text into a single prompt. It then uses the provided AI model to generate the suggestions and rewritten essay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **model** (`GenerativeModel`): The AI model used to generate the content.\n",
    "- **grading_feedback** (`str`): The feedback received from grading the essay, which includes the criterion, score, and explanation.\n",
    "- **essay_text** (`str`): The text of the essay to be improved and rewritten.\n",
    "- **retries** (`int`, optional): The number of times to retry the API request in case of resource exhaustion. Default is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "- **response.text** (`str`): The suggestions and rewritten essay generated by the model. If the API request fails after the specified number of retries, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "1. **Construct Prompt**: The function calls the `format_suggestions_and_rewrite_prompt` function, passing in the grading feedback and essay text. This function returns a formatted prompt string.\n",
    "2. **Generate Content**: The function uses the AI model to generate content based on the constructed prompt. It attempts to call the model's `generate_content` method.\n",
    "3. **Retry Mechanism**: If the API request fails due to resource exhaustion, the function catches the `ResourceExhausted` exception and retries the request up to the specified number of times, with exponential backoff between attempts.\n",
    "4. **Return Response**: If the model successfully generates a response, the function returns the generated text. If the request fails after all retries, the function returns `None`.\n"

    "# The essay text\n",
    "essay_text =  \"\"\"\n",
    "The history of the United States is marked by a continuous struggle for civil rights and equality, shaping the nation's identity and societal structure. From the early days of colonization to the modern era, the quest for civil rights has been a central theme, reflecting the dynamic and often tumultuous nature of the American democratic experiment. This ongoing journey has significantly influenced the development of American society and democracy.\n",
    "The roots of the civil rights movement can be traced back to the early colonial period, where notions of freedom and equality were paradoxically juxtaposed with the institution of slavery. The Declaration of Independence in 1776, with its proclamation that \"all men are created equal,\" laid a philosophical foundation for civil rights, yet this ideal was not extended to all individuals, particularly African Americans and Native Americans. The contradiction between the ideals of the Declaration and the reality of slavery set the stage for future conflicts and movements aimed at achieving true equality.\n",
    "The abolitionist movement of the 19th century was one of the earliest organized efforts to challenge slavery and advocate for the civil rights of African Americans. Figures such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and William Lloyd Garrison played pivotal roles in raising awareness and mobilizing support for the abolition of slavery. The publication of antislavery literature, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, also contributed to the growing sentiment against slavery in the North.\n",
    "The culmination of the abolitionist movement was the Civil War (1861-1865), a conflict fundamentally rooted in the issue of slavery. The Union's victory and the subsequent passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865 abolished slavery, marking a significant milestone in the struggle for civil rights. However, the end of slavery did not mean the end of discrimination or the beginning of true equality. The Reconstruction era (1865-1877) saw significant advancements, including the 14th and 15th Amendments, which granted citizenship and voting rights to African Americans. Despite these legal gains, the period was also marked by severe backlash, including the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the implementation of Jim Crow laws, which enforced racial segregation and disenfranchised Black citizens.\n",
    "The early 20th century witnessed the emergence of new civil rights organizations and leaders who sought to challenge segregation and discrimination through legal means and grassroots activism. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, played a crucial role in challenging discriminatory laws and practices through the court system. One of the most significant victories was the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared state laws establishing separate public schools for Black and white students to be unconstitutional.\n",
    "The 1950s and 1960s are often regarded as the height of the civil rights movement, a period characterized by widespread activism, landmark legislation, and profound social change. The movement was marked by nonviolent protests, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956) and the March on Washington (1963), where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech. These actions, along with the courage and determination of countless individuals, brought national attention to the injustices faced by African Americans.\n",
    "Key legislative achievements during this period included the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and ended segregation in public places. The Voting Rights Act aimed to eliminate barriers to voting for African Americans, particularly in the South, where practices such as literacy tests and poll taxes had been used to disenfranchise Black voters.\n",
    "Despite these significant advancements, the struggle for civil rights continued beyond the 1960s. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw ongoing efforts to address issues such as racial profiling, police brutality, and economic inequality. The Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in response to the killings of unarmed Black individuals by police, has brought renewed attention to the persistent racial disparities in American society.\n",
    "The quest for civil rights in the United States has not been limited to African Americans. Other marginalized groups, including women, Native Americans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and immigrants, have also fought for recognition and equality. The women's suffrage movement, which culminated in the 19th Amendment in 1920, granted women the right to vote and marked a significant step toward gender equality. The LGBTQ+ rights movement achieved a major victory with the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n",
    "Throughout American history, the struggle for civil rights has been a dynamic and multifaceted endeavor. It has involved legal battles, grassroots activism, and significant sacrifices by individuals committed to the cause of equality. The progress achieved has been substantial, yet the journey is ongoing, with new challenges and opportunities for advancing civil rights continuing to emerge.\n",
    "In conclusion, the history of civil rights in the United States is a testament to the resilience and determination of those who have fought for justice and equality. From the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and beyond, each generation has contributed to the ongoing effort to realize the ideals of freedom and equality upon which the nation was founded. As society continues to evolve, the legacy of these struggles serves as both a reminder of the progress made and a call to action to address the inequalities that persist today. The journey toward equality is far from over, but the commitment to civil rights remains a defining aspect of the American spirit. Each new movement and each legal victory brings the nation closer to the ideal of true equality, demonstrating that the pursuit of civil rights is an enduring and essential part of the American story. The impact of these movements reverberates through history, showcasing the power of collective action and the relentless pursuit of justice. As new challenges arise, the foundational values of equality and justice continue to guide and inspire future generations to push forward.\n",

The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw ongoing efforts to address issues such as racial profiling, police brutality, and economic inequality. The Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in response to the killings of unarmed Black individuals by police, has brought renewed attention to the persistent racial disparities in American society.\n",
       "The quest for civil rights in the United States has not been limited to African Americans. Other marginalized groups, including women, Native Americans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and immigrants, have also fought for recognition and equality. The women's suffrage movement, which culminated in the 19th Amendment in 1920, granted women the right to vote and marked a significant step toward gender equality. The LGBTQ+ rights movement achieved a major victory with the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n",
       "Throughout American history, the struggle for civil rights has been a dynamic and multifaceted endeavor. It has involved legal battles, grassroots activism, and significant sacrifices by individuals committed to the cause of equality. The progress achieved has been substantial, yet the journey is ongoing, with new challenges and opportunities for advancing civil rights continuing to emerge.\n",
       "In conclusion, the history of civil rights in the United States is a testament to the resilience and determination of those who have fought for justice and equality. From the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and beyond, each generation has contributed to the ongoing effort to realize the ideals of freedom and equality upon which the nation was founded. As society continues to evolve, the legacy of these struggles serves as both a reminder of the progress made and a call to action to address the inequalities that persist today. The journey toward equality is far from over, but the commitment to civil rights remains a defining aspect of the American spirit. \n",
